            <h2>User 1</h2>
            <p>Friend, 19 yrs</p>
            <p>
                <b>1. How is the hover cue that appears on the pictures above the desk?</b><br>
                Pretty intuitive, but maybe could be improved on. Maybe add hover over each picture and an overlay for each.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Does the layout of the overlay work? How is the overall flow (photos on one side, description on the other, close button at the very end)?</b><br>
                Maybe a little less white space under the text would help the flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Is it inutitive to hover over each picture on the overlay to get a description, or should there be a more obvious indicator?</b><br>
                It's only obvious if you accidentally hover over one.
            </p>


            <h2>User 2</h2>
            <p>Mom, 44 yrs</p>
            <p>
                <b>1. How is the hover cue that appears on the pictures above the desk?</b><br>
                It works well, but it probably shouldn't go over the computer drawing on the desk.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Does the layout of the overlay work? How is the overall flow (photos on one side, description on the other, close button at the very end)?</b><br>
                It would make sense to add a picture of me and my brother as an introduction picture because that's the title of the project. It would help add more context for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Is it inutitive to hover over each picture on the overlay to get a description, or should there be a more obvious indicator?</b><br>
                The hover could be more obvious, maybe prompt the user.
            </p>


            <h2>User 3</h2>
            <p>Friend, 21 yrs</p>
            <p>
                <b>1. How is the hover cue that appears on the pictures above the desk?</b><br>
                Little awkward, it goes over the computer and it is quite big.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Does the layout of the overlay work? How is the overall flow (photos on one side, description on the other, close button at the very end)?</b><br>
                It's not super intuitive to have the only option for exiting the overlay to be at the very end of the scroll. Maybe adding an option where you can click outside the overlay to exit as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Is it inutitive to hover over each picture on the overlay to get a description, or should there be a more obvious indicator?</b><br>
                It's pretty obvious, but maybe align the caption under the images to the center.
            </p>


            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Improve on the initial hover. Make it not as large, or look into other ways to show that the component is clickable.</p>
            <p>Make the overall design better. There is awkward white space and alignment issues that mess with flow. Make the exit button more intuitive by giving user more options for how to close the overlay.</p>
            <p>Make it more apparent that the picture in the overlay can be interacted with.</p>
