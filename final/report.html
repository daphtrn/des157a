            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><b>Summary of Key Findings</b></p>
            <p>Overall, users found the usability of the project pretty straightforward. There are a few minor things that can be improved on. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exiting overlay by pressing outside the overlay.</li>
                <li>Unsure if they should click or the computer first or pictures first.</li>
                <li>Photos blend into the background a little.</li>
                <li>More interactivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Users tested</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dad, 66 years old</li>
                <li>Close friend, 23 years old</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I wanted my target audience to be people that are close to me that know Justin to some extent. My intention with this project is to give people a better idea of who Justin is and my relationship with him. If they’re someone who knows him really well, like my family, then I want this project to serve as a way to appreciate my brother.</p>

            <p><b>Task list</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on computer</li>
                <li>Click through photos</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p><b>Usability problems</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exiting overlay by pressing outside the overlay:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is intuitive for the users to automatically press outside of the overlay to exit, rather than navigating to a “close” button every time. This is based on previous encounters with this in other applications.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exiting overlay by pressing outside the overlay:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>May be important to make it obvious to the user that it is helpful to turn to the computer first for context before going through the pictures.</p>

            <p><b>Other feedback</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exiting overlay by pressing outside the overlay:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make the white border on the photos a little darker so it stands out against the background.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exiting overlay by pressing outside the overlay:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The current project is pretty simple, and it would benefit from more interactivity.</p>
