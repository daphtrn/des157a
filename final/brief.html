            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm choosing to update my Every Picture project because I want to further push the message I'm trying to convey, and this project has the most room for improvements.</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>In my Every Picture project, I plan to push functionality and UI/UX the most. Currently, my work is quite simple, and I feel I can add a lot more interactions (like with zooming or mouse positions). I can add these interactions to the other items on my desk. I think I have design skills that could be featured my prominently in the project as well. For example, improving the color palette or smaller visual discrepencies. In terms of usability, there aren't too many issues, but I think that some of the design changes I plan to make will help.</p> 

            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>My target audience for this project are people in my life who may want to know more about me or my brother, which would be primarily friends and family.</p>

                <b>Mom, 44 yrs old:</b><br>
                There are a few grammatical errors in the text. She also points out that the title of the project is "My Brother and I," but I never include any pictures of myself, or pictures of him and I. It would make the story more personal and add more context for readers. Overall, she finds the project very sweet.

                <b>Friend, 19 yrs old:</b><br>
                My friend thinks I can be more creative with the presentation of the pictures. She says that I should try to replace the large hover over all the pictures with a hover over each individual one. With this, I would have to create overlays for each picture, rather than one big one that scrolls.
