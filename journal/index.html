                    <p class="part">Part 1</p>

                    <img src="images/justin.jpg" alt="picture of my brother posed with a mannequin" width="274px" height="365px">

                    <p>I quite like this image because I find it really endearing. My brother and I were at the Uniqlo in my hometown’s mall. Every once in a while, he’ll see a mannequin that he wants to pose and take a picture next to. I always wonder what drives him to pick particular mannequins over others.</p>

                    <p>All the images in my collection are of my younger brother. Every once in a while, he’ll ask me to take a picture of him doing something. He has autism, so there are certain subjects he has a very keen interest in and will always ask me to take a picture of him doing them. My brother loves to look back on these images and almost relive what he felt.</p>

                    <p>I think these photos are a great representation of our dynamic and relationship. We’re quite close and have a lot of fun with each other. He sometimes feels embarrassed to share things he likes to do with others, but is comfortable enough with me to do so.</p>

                    <p class="part">Part 2</p>

                    <img src="images/snowman.jpg" alt="snowman" width="274px" height="365px">

                    <p>This is an image of a snowman. I think the most interesting thing about this image is obviously the finger being used to cover the snowman’s eyes. I think that I spent a lot of time wondering why the finger is there. Is there something he is hiding? Did something go wrong with its eyes? It’s interesting because it almost makes the snowman more “snow” than “man” without the eyes. Looking at the snowman without its eyes reminds me of a concept I learned in psychology. They tested newborns to see if they preferred three shapes that were organized in the shape of two eyes and a mouth (like a face) or in a different orientation. They found that the babies had a much bigger preference for the orientation resembling a face. All that to say, it’s interesting that he decided to cover the part of the snowman that humanizes it.</p>

                <h2>3. Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
                <date>10/22/24</date>
                <article>
                    <p>Over the past few decades, our access to visual media, as well as the technology to capture this media, has skyrocketed. As a result, knowing how to effectively analyze visual media is both a fun and useful skill to have now. </p> 

                    <p>We often glance at images without much thought. Taking a closer look at all the details and context of any kind of visual media can open the door to many more questions than just a glance would. Once you notice something in an image, it becomes easier to build on top with more observations by using context clues.</p>

                    <p>Paying attention to how you analyze something can also be unknowingly useful. What catches your eye first, and why? What’s in the background and foreground, and how does it add to the subject of the image?</p>

                <h2>2. Overlay Design</h2>
                <date>10/18/24</date>
                <article>
                    <p>Modals, overlays, and dialogs are all interchangeable. They serve as a good way to reduce the amount of screen space you need to use, which combats cognitive overload. The article lists a few of the reasons you may want to use a modal screen. These include grabbing the user’s attention, when you need an input from the user, and showing additional information in context and not in context.</p> 

                    <p>One of the key features of a modal window is that it doesn’t take up the entire screen when opened. Additionally, there usually includes a way to close the window and return to the original page. This can come in the form of a button (close or cancel), or a discrete action like using the escape key or clicking outside the window itself.</p>

                    <p>Something important to note are modals on mobile devices. It is usually advised to stay away from doing this because content can be difficult to view on such a small screen.</p>

                <h2>1. Form Design</h2>
                <date>10/14/24</date>

                <article>
                    <p>The overarching message of this article on form design is to keep things short, clear, and as user friendly as possible. I thought the article was extremely informative actually, and taught me a lot of “best practices” I have yet to learn about forms.</p>

                    <p>For example, making sure the form has a one column layout helps with the users’ natural flow. I was actually quite surprised by this because I feel that a lot of forms I’ve seen often use two or three column layouts.</p> 

                    <p>Splitting the form into multiple steps to reduce cognitive load was also something I found very helpful. I feel that dividing complex information into more digestible steps is useful to keep in mind for many other situations in UX design.</p> 

                    <p>A smaller tip that was mentioned in the article was about different labels for form questions. The article recommends against inline labels because users will no longer be able to see what the label is asking for once they start typing. Adding a label on top of the input box or to the left is a better option.</p>
