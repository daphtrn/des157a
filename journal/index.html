        <h2>1. Form Design</h2>

        <article>
            <p>The overarching message of this article on form design is to keep things short, clear, and as user friendly as possible. I thought the article was extremely informative actually, and taught me a lot of “best practices” I have yet to learn about forms.</p>

            <p>For example, making sure the form has a one column layout helps with the users’ natural flow. I was actually quite surprised by this because I feel that a lot of forms I’ve seen often use two or three column layouts.</p> 

            <p>Splitting the form into multiple steps to reduce cognitive load was also something I found very helpful. I feel that dividing complex information into more digestible steps is useful to keep in mind for many other situations in UX design.</p> 

            <p>A smaller tip that was mentioned in the article was about different labels for form questions. The article recommends against inline labels because users will no longer be able to see what the label is asking for once they start typing. Adding a label on top of the input box or to the left is a better option.</p>
