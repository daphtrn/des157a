            <article>
                <p>Modals, overlays, and dialogs are all interchangeable. They serve as a good way to reduce the amount of screen space you need to use, which combats cognitive overload. The article lists a few of the reasons you may want to use a modal screen. These include grabbing the user’s attention, when you need an input from the user, and showing additional information in context and not in context.</p> 

                <p>One of the key features of a modal window is that it doesn’t take up the entire screen when opened. Additionally, there usually includes a way to close the window and return to the original page. This can come in the form of a button (close or cancel), or a discrete action like using the escape key or clicking outside the window itself.</p>

                <p>Something important to note are modals on mobile devices. It is usually advised to stay away from doing this because content can be difficult to view on such a small screen.</p>

            <date>10/14/24</date>

            <article>
                <p>The overarching message of this article on form design is to keep things short, clear, and as user friendly as possible. I thought the article was extremely informative actually, and taught me a lot of “best practices” I have yet to learn about forms.</p>

                <p>For example, making sure the form has a one column layout helps with the users’ natural flow. I was actually quite surprised by this because I feel that a lot of forms I’ve seen often use two or three column layouts.</p> 

                <p>Splitting the form into multiple steps to reduce cognitive load was also something I found very helpful. I feel that dividing complex information into more digestible steps is useful to keep in mind for many other situations in UX design.</p> 

                <p>A smaller tip that was mentioned in the article was about different labels for form questions. The article recommends against inline labels because users will no longer be able to see what the label is asking for once they start typing. Adding a label on top of the input box or to the left is a better option.</p>
