                        <p>His special intersts are so specific, and he loves sharing them with others. I find it really funny that despite his limited communication skills, he still finds a way to yap my ear off about the things he likes.</p>

                        <p>My siblings and I are pretty close with each other. With Justin in particular, we have a "nontraditional" relationship because of his autism and limited communication.</p>
                        
                        <p>Justin loves looking through pictures. He especially loves looking through photos of him doing the things he loves, or doing something he finds funny. However, he can sometimes be embarrassed to share these interests with others.</p>
                        
                        <p>Justin always asks me to take pictures of him, and my camera roll is filled with photos like these. Because he can't really share his interests with me verbally, I feel that him asking me to take these photos is his way of sharing his interests with me. I always feel very lucky that he's comfortable enough to do so. Even when I'm away at school, I'm always reminded of home</p>
