                    <p>My little brother, Justin, and I have always been very close. However, we have a nontraditional sibling relationship</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Justin loves looking through pictures. He especially loves looking through photos of him doing the things he loves, or doing something he finds funny.</p>

                        <p>He loves birthday parties!</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>However, he can sometimes be embarrassed to share these interests with others. He also has very limited verbal communication skills, which also makes it hard to share.</p>

                        <p>A whole turkey leg to himself (this boy loves eating meat).</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Justin always asks me to take pictures of him, and my camera roll is filled with photos like these.</p>

                        <p>Scary mask!</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>With his limited verbal skills, I feel that him asking me to take these photos is his way of sharing his interests with me. I always feel very lucky that he's comfortable enough to do so.<br>
                    Even when I'm away at school, I'm always reminded of home</p>
